# ðŸ¤– About Me
- I'm an Associate Professor working at NUDT in China. I also serve as an Associate Editor for IEEE RA-L, ICRA, and IROS.

- My research focuses on robot learning, perception, and navigation, with the goal of enabling autonomous systems to understand and navigate complex environments. I am particularly interested in self-learning frameworks that leverage spatial-temporal cues for building meaningful representations of the world and improving localization and navigation through continuous interaction with dynamic environments. I have authored over 90 peer-reviewed papers in leading robotics venues, including TRO, RAL, RSS, ICRA, IROS, and CVPR. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kl3niOYAAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FChen-Xieyuanli%2Fchen-xieyuanli.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Google%20Scholar"></a>
