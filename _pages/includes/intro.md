# ðŸ¤– About Me
- I'm a Scientist working at Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in Singapore. 

- My research focuses on perception and planning in embodied AI, aiming to empower autonomous systems with the ability to perceive, understand, and navigate complex 3D environments. I work at the intersection of 3D scene understanding, motion planning, and vision-language model, with the goal of bridging visual perception and intelligent decision-making. I have authored over 20 peer-reviewed papers in leading venues, including TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, RAL, ICRA and IROS.
